This perl script tool (really just nrpod.pl) is the automation of the podcast 
capture ond process precedure for the North Ringwood Uniting Church.

It's really rough as guts and uses cocoaDialog to provide a rudimentray 
GUI interface for some aspects.

Dont upgrade to OS-X Mountain Lion (10.8) because cocoaDialog will stop working.

There are a number of ancilliary tools used such as:
	- cdlabelgen
	- sox
	- ffmpeg
	- audacity
	- cocoadialog
	- lame

Used to complete the process. Also a number of Mac tools are used such as:
	- drutil

And a number of perl modules such as:
	XML::Smart;
	File::Basename;
	File::Path qw(make_path);
	File::Glob;
	Switch;
	Getopt::Long;
	Pod::Usage;
	Data::Dumper;
	Audio::Wav;
	Config::Simple;
	Time::localtime;
	IO::File;
	Term::ReadLine;
